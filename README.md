# Network Port Scanner (Simple Version) using Java

This Java application provides a command-line interface for scanning open ports on a target system within a network. The simple version is designed for ease of use in a non-graphical environment, offering a straightforward way to configure, initiate, and view the results of port scans.

## Features

### 1. Target Host Input
Specify the target host, which can be an IP address or a domain name. This is the system you want to scan for open ports.

### 2. Port Range Configuration
Define the range of ports to scan by specifying the start and end port numbers. This flexibility allows users to narrow down or broaden the scope of the scan.

### 3. Real-time Results Display
View the scan results in the console in real-time. Open ports are listed, providing instant feedback on the status of each port.

### 4. Timeout Mechanism
Each port connection attempt includes a timeout mechanism, preventing the application from hanging on unresponsive ports and improving overall scanning efficiency.

### 5. Error Handling
The application incorporates robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where a connection cannot be established to a specific port, ensuring a smooth user experience.

### 6. Scanning Efficiency
The timeout mechanism and error handling contribute to the overall scanning efficiency, allowing for a reliable and quick assessment of open ports.
